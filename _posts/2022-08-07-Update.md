### Guess who's back!
First of all... I may go back and spell check that last post. Wow...I may have been drinking that evening.
To catch you up though... I got divorced (not since the last update but close), bought a house, got a promotion, got in a car accident and replaced my car, took up kayaking ...its been a very busy time.
However...this weekend I:
- Got the parts out of storage (i.e. sitting in the backyard against the shed)
- Hosed them down and got them physically back in place
- Re-plumbed the lines from the sump to the tubes
- Got the flow set so that the flush works
- Built a holding box around the fish tank
- Plumbed the return to the fish-tank
- Plumbed the skimmer to the filter

#### Problems remaining / todo list
- [ ] cut slots in lower skimmer intake where it sits on the bottom of the tank
- [ ] 2" UniSeal the link between filter where the skimmer is plumbed in
- [ ] 2" UniSeal the link between the filter and the sump
- [ ] Plumb filter to sump
- [ ] Tighten everything up and tie it down (remove zip ties and leaks, trim PVC, etc...)
- [ ] Instrument the system (more on this below)
- [ ] Add Fish and plants 

#### Instrumentation
- Flow meters x3
  - Between pump and inlet to #1 tube
  - Between #1 tube outlet / #2 tube inlet
  - Between fish-tank and #2 tube outlet
- Level sensors x4
  - Near #1 tube outlet
  - Near #2 tube outlet
  - Filter inlet (measures fish-tank level as well)
  - Sump
- Temp x4
  - Same locations as level sensors
- Maybe
  - Amps on pump
  - light in various places
  - ?

### Correction's
In the begining I said that I wanted to elbows to face up in the 4" caps. Thats not true...they all face down to ensure they drain fully and break the syphon. I need to get a system diagram out there....I will work on that.
