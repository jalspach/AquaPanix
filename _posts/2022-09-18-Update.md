We have some small greenery!
{% capture string_with_newlines %}
While I have lost 3 more fish, I have some small plants! So cool :-) Now lets just hope they grow.
I have been taking pictures of the thermometer every time I open the lid and feed the fish. A ToDo for me is to log all of that.
Need to make sure to tighten down the filter lid to keep skeeters from breading. Still not sure if the Bell Siphons are working. I got my depth, Temperature, 1 flow sensor and 2 raspberry pi pico w 's last Friday... time to make them work!
