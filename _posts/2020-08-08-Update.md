So this will not actually be published for a while because i want to see what what I can get done this weekend. My hope is to actually plumb everything together, I have the rock in place and rinsed once. I will need some more rinsing but I should be close. My hope is to test the solids filter for how it removes the rinse output.

## Saturday
Nothing to see here...just keep moving. ;-)

##Sunday
