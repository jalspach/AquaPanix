## Where have I been?
I have been MIA...although you would think COVID-19 woudl make it simple to work on a project like this...life has taken over and I have stayed too busy. I am in the process of *HOPEFULLY* (I think) buying the house we live in and while that will give me a perminant spot (more permanant somehow than the 18 years we have lived here already) it will also sap any extra money I have. No more Aquaponics, Pinpabb parts or random elecronicts projects for a while. We will just have to see how it goes though.
Anyway...i will try to do better about keeping this uptated more often...I need to look back to see if I may have done SOMETHING since my last update that I can include...don't hold yoru breath though.
