We got the plants...seeds anyway
{% capture string_with_newlines %}
Having some struggles with the bell siphons not breaking :-/ But it seems like it sometimes works so...I put seeds in tonight. I am pretty excited. We will see hot it comes out. They are not seedlings just straight seeds so...hard to say really lol

| Row | 00 | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
