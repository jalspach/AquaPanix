Cut the second stick of planting tube today. The trick (as any smart person probably guessed already) is a chalk line along the top as a place to always put your pilot bit and someway to minimize rotation around the center axes or along the line of the pipe. thats all :-/ anyway the holes are not perfect but will do for sure.
I also got the last two ends built. I think the internal elbow on the feed pipe should probably face down. If it is up, that will start a siphon almost immediately and I don't want that. I want the row above to soak for a bit. In building the ends I found that my uni-bit is fantastic. The largest ring is too big but just below that is a very tight fit for 1/2" PVC. Once I hammer the PVC in place I doubt there will be any leaks from those joints.
We got the sump, pump and both sticks flowing well tonight

## Next ToDo's
* Adjust the sticks to be slightly less level.
  * While the water drains fine due to the syphon, it would be a little better if the water pooled very slightly, in the downstream end.
* Put media in the cups
* Raise the fish tank
* Build clarifier
* Plumb fish tank and clarifier
