Quite a weekend!
This will be quick and then I will edit it later.
* Added the beginnings of a bio filter
* Upgraded the filter with a deeper initial catch. This should make the system more efficient.
* Upgraded the in tank fish -> Filter piping with a longer extension (to  cover more of the bottom) that has holes drilled in it
* Added 15 (minus one floater) fish (this may have been premature as the water still gets too warm. I think because of the filter tank.)
    * Cooled the system with ice and with ice packs. Wasn't really enough.
* Tightened some things up to minimize leaks

I really need to figure out the real names for parts of the system so that I can be more specific as I make changes

New idea - I need to divert some of the pumped water right to the fish tank. This will stir up the bottom a little, add more volume pushing water through the filter and if I work it right, help aerate the tank.
