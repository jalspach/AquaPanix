{% capture string_with_newlines %}
Not a ton of progress but more to add to my ToDo list (a post I still need to figure out the best way to break out)First I need to get my blog system to recognize a <cr><lf>. Everything looks like a big giant paragraph.
For the system though I need a stick of 2" exiting from the filter into the bio-bucket. Lots of ideas of how to do this but I am leaning towards a piece about 18" long that will be capped and sit on the bottom of the bucket. Above that point will be holes drilled so that the water squirts out into the bio media. Right now it rains down out of the 90 and is perfect except that there is no rigidity and the outflow pipe sags on the outside, raising the level of water in the filter.
    Oh... a thought just came to me...I may use some leftover french drain as a prop and let the 90 rain into that.
Need to graph the temp vs the outside temp to see how its doing. The fish seem happy though. I feed them once a day after work. I leave the lid open so that they can get some sun and then close it again after it gets dark.
