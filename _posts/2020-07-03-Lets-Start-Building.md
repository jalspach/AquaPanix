This first day of building I got the A-Frame built and one tube set up from end to end. Other entries will cover other parts of the build.

## A-Frame

## Tubes
Make sure to level each hole. After drilling a hole, it is important to lay a torpedo level across it to help keep the remaining hols centered.

### Tube Caps
There are two different cap assemblies depending on whether it is for the feed side or the syphon side.
- Feed side, a hole is drilled into the center of the cap. The hole is slightly smaller than the OD of 1/2 schedule 40 PVC pipe. This hole is cut to 7/8" for a small ways into the cap leaving the rest at 13/16". 1/2" pipe can be started into the larger side of the hole and then driven through the rest of the way. On the inside and outside of the cap, an elbow is attached. These elbows both face "up" so that water comes from above travels through a U shape and is expelled up inside the pipe. This provides a little aeration and helps ensure water never syphons back if there is a leak.
- Syphon side, as above a 1/2" pvc pipe is driven through the cap. However, in this case the hole is off center to allow the internal bell to be as close to the pipe wall as possible. Once the 1/2" pipe is in place, a 1/2" elbow is mounted facing up on the outside. On the inside however, a 3/4" to 1/2" elbow is attached facing down. This forms the syphon bell which insures all of the water is drawn out of the pipe.
