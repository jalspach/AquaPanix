Cut the second stick of planting tube today. The trick (as any smart person probably guessed already) is a chalk line along the top as a place to always put your pilot bit and someway to minimize rotation around the center axes or along the line of the pipe. thats all :-/ anyway the holes are not perfect but will do for sure.
I also got the last two ends built. I think the internal elbow on the feed pipe should probably face down. If it is up, that will start a siphon almost immediately and I don't want that. I want the row above to soak for a bit.
