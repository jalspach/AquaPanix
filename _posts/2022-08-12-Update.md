Bought some rubber gaskets (actually a 2" flush valve shank washer) last night that seal the 2" connections into and out of the settling tank. They work great so far and basically turn 1 2" MPT x S and 1 2" S x FPT, into a bulkhead connection...at least in this no pressure application.
As of tonight the system is flowing fully. 
I still need to do a few things. I think I will build a ToDo entry (not to mention an overview of the system with a diagram) but one big thing is to tighten up all the connections (there are a lot of little drips).
