Finally got the tanks for the system. It remains to be seen how they are going to work out but I am hopeful.

## Tanks
I ended up with a 55 gal tote for the fish, a 38 gallon tote for the sump and a 35 gallon trash can for the settling tank / solids filter. I am excited to get it all plumbed together.
