## Why do this at all?
Part of the problem is that I am not sure how much we will really eat. It would be a pretty easy sell if we were a family of vegetarians and fish lovers. Unfortunately I may be the only one who loves fish and none of us really devour veggies. With the exception of broccoli but I am not sure if that will work in an NFT row.
For me, while I will eat any fish I raise and I am sure we will use a lot of what I grow, its more about the system and making that work.
If I hit the lotto, I would love to do two things:
- Start a business selling "Intermodal Containers" (an ISO standardized CONEX (CONtainer EXpress) box also known as a Sea Can) which are pre-built farms. These containers are standard sized which would make fitting them out fairly simple and repeatable
- Start a commercial farm in a store. This would allow walk in customers to see the process and purchase plants and fish fresh from the "farm". These items could also be provided to local restaurants again being about as fresh food as someone could hope for.

## Background Docs
Other than just general poking around, my two major sources for info are:
 - [Rob Bob](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChz2QEbZECEzUih1DiqZTNA)
 - Aquaponics book


## Plan
My basic plan is to just give it all a try but without spending a bunch of $. I have some idec smart relays in NEMA boxes that I would love to incorporate as well but, we will see. They are end of life and so the only way to program them is from the face which looks like it may be a PITA. More on all of that later.

## Numbers
Clearly...more on this later as I convert my back of napkin work into real data. This is actually more like a flood and drain system built in tubes.
Growing space provides X wet media bed
that much media bed supports x amount of food
that much food supports x amount of fish
that much fish requires x sized tank
Fish require solids and bio filtering which together is x
sump needs to support all of that water
Pump needs to turn over the entire system x times per hour

## Purchases
I will try to break down and keep track of what this project cost me. This is probably a bad idea but, I want to know lol
